I am an Assistant Professorial Research Fellow at the [Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment](http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Home.aspx), [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk). I am also Deputy Director of the [Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy](http://www.cccep.ac.uk), a Co-Editor of the [Environmental and Resource Economics](https://www.springer.com/journal/10640) journal, and a [DIW](https://www.diw.de/en) Fellow.

My research explores the barriers to delivering a rapid low carbon transition, particularly for industrial sectors. Much of my work evaluates the effectiveness of climate change and energy policies, and quantifies their impacts on firmsâ€™ environmental and economic outcomes using economic evaluation methods. I am also interested in measuring how the low-carbon transition is changing the demand for skills in the labour force.
